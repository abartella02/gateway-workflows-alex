# Tanium Importer  
**Bluecat Gateway Version:** v20.3.1 and greater  
**BlueCat Address Manager Version:** v9.1 and greater  

This workflow will import the client device information stored in the Tanium Server into BlueCat Address Manager.  
When import is executed, BlueCat Address Manager will perform IP address reconciliation depending on what is imported.  


## Prerequisites  
1. **BAM Default Configuration**  
This workflow will be using the default configuration value in `/portal/bluecat_portal/config.py` in BlueCat Gateway container.  To set the default configuration, in BlueCat Gateway, go to Administration > Configurations > General Configuration.  
In General Configuration, select the BAM Settings tab and enter the configuration name under "Default Configuration:" and save.

2. **Additional Python Code**  
This workflow requires addtional python code.  
Copy directory *"tanium"* under `additional/` to `/portal/bluecat_portal/customizations/integrations/` inside the BlueCat Gateway container.  

3. **jqGrid**  
This workflow requires jqGrid.  
Download jqGrid from [HERE](http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=6).  
After downloading, extract the following three files: *"ui.jqgrid.css"*, *"jquery.jqGrid.min.js"* and *"grid.locale-xx.js"*.  
*"grid.locale-xx.js"* will change depending on the locale you choose to use.  
(For instance, for Japan it will be *"grid.locale-ja.js"*)  
Copy *"ui.jqgrid.css"* and *"jquery.jqGrid.min.js"* under `/portal/static/js/vendor/jqgrid/` inside the Bluecat Gateway container.  
Create a new directory `jqgrid` under `/portal/static/js/vendor/` if none exists.  
Copy *"grid.locale-xx.js"* under `/portal/static/js/vendor/jqgrid/i18n/` inside the Bluecat Gateway container.  
Create a new directory `i18n` under `/portal/static/js/vendor/jqgrid` if none exists.    

4. **UDF**  
This workflow requires additional UDF to the **MAC Address object** in BAM.  
Add the following UDF to the **MAC Address object** in BAM.  
  - System  
  Field Name: System    
  Display Name: System   
  Type: Text  
  - Imported Source    
  Field Name: ImportedSource  
  Display Name: Imported Source   
  Type: Text  


## Usage   
1. **Setting Tanium Importer Parameters**  
Click the *"Tanium Configuration"* pull down menu to open up parameter settings.  
Set the following parameters.    

    <img src = "img/tanium_importer1.jpg" width = "600px">  


- Server Address:  
The Tanium server IP address or the FQDN of the Tanium server.  

- User ID:  
A username which is registered in the Tanium Server.    

- Password:  
The corresponding password for the username entered above.     

  **Retry count and Intervals**  
  Whenever loading Tanium clients via API, the Tanium server will fetch to each endpoint and acquire the latest information. This takes time and therefore loading all Tanium clients might take more than one API call.   
  The retry counts and the intervals make it possible for the importer to retry the API call until it acquires the necessary  client information.  

- Retry Count:  
The number of retries for the API call.  
The default and recommended value is **4**.

- Interval (Seconds):  
The number of seconds between retries.  
The default and recommended value is **3**.  

2. **Setting Target Networks**  
Set the network(s) of the Tanium clients you wish to acquire with CIDR notation.  

    <img src = "img/tanium_importer2.jpg" width = "600px">  

    Muliple networks can be targeted with a comma separator.  
    (e.g. `192.168.10.0/24, 10.10.10.0/24`)  

    **"Include Discovered" Loading Option**  
    By toggling on this option, when loading, it will also load the clients which **DO NOT** have Tanium Agents installed.  
    This is possible because of the *"Discover"* function of Tanium.  
    Default is toggled off (meaning it will only load clients with Tanium Agents installed).  


3. **Loading Tanium Client Lists**  

    <img src = "img/tanium_client_list_initial.jpg" width = "600px">  

    By clicking the *"LOAD"* button, client information stored in Tanium Server will be loaded to the list.  
    By default, only the clients which **DO NOT MATCH** will be loaded to the list.  
    **DO NOT MATCH** means that there is either a *"mismatched IP address"* or an *"unknown IP address"* between the information stored in Tanium Server and the information stored in BlueCat Address Manager.  

+ *"Mismatched IP address"* => An IP address that exists in both BlueCat Address Manager and in Tanium Server, but where the MAC address does not match.  

+ *"Unknown IP address"* => An IP address that exists in Tanium Server, but not in BlueCat Address Manager. This likely represents an address that has been added to the network since the last discovery.  

**Loading Options**  
There are two loading options which you can toggle on or off when loading. Default is toggled off.  
- Include Matches  
When this option is toggled on, it will additionally load the clients which **MATCH**, meaning IP addresses that exists in both BlueCat Address Manager and in Tanium Server where the MAC address match as well.  

- Include IPAM only  
When this option is toggled on, it will load the clients which only exists in BlueCat Address Manager. These clients will be listed as a *"reclaimable IP address"*.  

    + *"Reclaimable IP Address"* => An IP address that exists in BlueCat Address Manager, but not in Tanium Server. This may represent a device that was turned off at the time of the discovery, or the address may no longer exist on the network.

**Tanium Client List**    

  <img src = "img/tanium_client_list_loaded.jpg" width = "600px">   

- TA  
Indicates whether a *"Tanium Agent"* is installed.  
  + This icon ![screenshot](img/good.gif "good") will show when a *"Tanium Agent"* is installed in the client.  

  + This icon ![screenshot](img/unknown.gif "unknown") will show when a *"Tanium Agent"* is not installed in the client.  
    These clients will only appear when the *"Include Discovered"* loading option is toggled on.  

- IP Address  
The IP Address of the loaded client.  

- MAC Address  
The MAC Address of the loaded client.  

- Name  
The computer name of the loaded client (if exists).  

- System  
The operating system of the loaded client (if exists).  

- State  
The IP address state of the loaded client.  
  + This icon ![screenshot](img/check.gif) represents the state **Matched**. When a client of this state is imported, it will not update the IP address and MAC address information in BlueCat Address Manager (since it is already a match) but will add additional information obtained by Tanium Server.  

  + This icon ![screenshot](img/about.gif "about") represents the state **Mismatched**. When a client of this state is imported, it will update the MAC address information in BlueCat Address Manager and add additional information obtained by Tanium Server.  

  + This icon ![screenshot](img/help.gif "help") represents the state **Unknown**. When a client of this state is imported, it will update both IP address and MAC address information in BlueCat Address Manager and add additional information obtained by Tanium Server.  

  + This icon ![screenshot](img/data_delete.gif "data_delete") represents the state **Reclaimable**. When a client of this state is imported, it will reclaim the IP address in BlueCat Address Manager.  

- Last Discovered  
Timestamp of the last time Tanium server discovered the client. The importer will determine whether an IP address is reclaimable or not depending on the last discovered time. If more than 30 days have passed since the last discovered time, the importer will assume the IP address is reclaimable and change the *"state"* icon of the client to **Reclaimable** (![screenshot](img/data_delete.gif "data_delete") )    
**IMPORTANT:**  
Before reclaiming an IP address, please bear in mind that there is a good possibility that even though an IP address shows as a **Reclaimable** state in the list, it is actually still assigned and thus should not be reclaimed. This will happen when more than 30 days have passed since the last discovered time. Make sure the IP address is reclaimable before actually reclaiming it.  

3. **Importing**  
After thoroughly checking the state of the loaded clients, select the clients you wish to import by checking on the checkbox. You can either select them one by one or select all by checking the top left check box in the list.  

    <img src = "img/tanium_client_list_check.jpg" width = "600px">  


    Click *IMPORT* to import data into BlueCat Address Manager.  
    By Clicking *CANCEL*, the whole list will be cleared.  

    **DHCP range IP addresses**  
    If the imported IP address happens to be within a DHCP range, then it will **NOT** update the IP address and MAC address information in BlueCat Address Manager and will only add additional information obtained by Tanium Server.  

4. **Checking imported information**  
Once imported, check the device information in BlueCat Address Manager.
