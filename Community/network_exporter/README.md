2. **UDF**  
This workflow requires the following UDF.  
Add the following UDF to IPv4 Objects > IPv4 Address object in BAM.  
  - Comments  
  Field Name: Comments   
  Display Name: Comments  
  Type: Text  
  - Owner  
  Field Name: Owner
  Display Name: Owner   
  Type: Text  

    Add the following UDF to IPv4 Objects > IPv4 Address Range object in BAM.  
  - Comments  
  Field Name: Comments   
  Display Name: Comments  
  Type: Text  
  - VLAN ID  
  Field Name: VLANID  
  Display Name: VLAN ID    
  Type: Text  

3. **Python3 openpyxl library**  
This workflow requires the python3 openpyxl library.  
Install openpyxl library using PIP3 inside the BlueCat Gateway container.
```
$pip3 install openpyxl

```  

4. **jqGrid**  
This workflow requires jqGrid in the html templates as shown below:  
![screenshot](img/network_exp_html1.jpg?raw=true "network_exp_html1")  
![screenshot](img/network_exp_html2.jpg?raw=true "network_exp_html2")  

    Download jqGrid from [HERE](http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=6).  
    After downloading, extract the following two files: *"ui.jqgrid.css"* and *"jquery.jqGrid.min.js"*.  
    Copy the two files to `/portal/static/js/vendor/jqgrid/` inside the Bluecat Gateway container.  

## Usage   

1. **Expand tree view**  
Expand tree view and inspect data.  
Existing blocks / networks information will be shown here.

2. **Specify block or network and export**  
Specify a block or a network.  
Choose format:  *Excel* or *CSV*.  
Choose contents: *Network Structure*, *IP Address* or *Structure and IP Address*.  
Check *Export unallocated IP Address* if you wish to export unallocated IP addresses.  
Click *DOWNLOAD*

## Additional  

1. **Adding additional UDF columns**  
If you wish to add more UDF columns to the table, you can do so by editing the *config_en.json* file.  
The *range* section corresponds to blocks and networks.  
      <img src="img/network_exporter5.jpg" width="320px"> 　　

      *id* corresponds to the Field Name of the IPv4 Address Range object.  
      *title* corresponds to name of the column.  
      *width* corresponds to the width of the column when exported to a spreadsheet.  
      *gwidth* corresponds to the width of the column shown on the BlueCat Gateway web UI.  

      Add the above at the end of the *range* section for each column.  
      For example,  

  ```
  {
      "id": "networktest",  
      "title": "network_test",  
      "width": 20,  
      "gwidth": 200  
  },  
  ```   

  The *address* section corresponds to IPv4 addresses.  
  <img src="img/network_exporter6.jpg" width="320px">   

*id* corresponds to the Field Name of the IPv4 Address object.  
      *title* corresponds to the title of the column.  
      *width* corresponds to the width of the column when exported to a spreadsheet.  

Add the above at the end of the *address* section for each column.  
      For example,  
  ```
  {
      "id": "ipv4addrtest",
      "title": "ipv4addr_test",
      "width": 20  
  },
  ```

Make sure the corresponding UDFs exist on BAM prior to adding additional columns.  
Edit the *config_ja.json* file for Japanese.  

2. **Language**  
You can switch to a Japanese menu by doing the following.  
    1. Create *ja.txt* in the BlueCat Gateway container.  
    ```
    cd /portal/Administration/create_workflow/text/  
    cp en.txt ja.txt  
    ```  
    2. In the BlueCat Gateway Web UI, go to Administration > Configurations > General Configuration.   
    In General Configuration, select the *Customization* tab.  
    Under *Language:* type in `ja` and save.  
    ![screenshot](img/langauge_ja.jpg?raw=true "langauge_ja")  

3. **Appearance**  
This will make the base html menus a little bit wider.  
    1. Copy all files under the directory `additional/templates` to `/portal/templates` inside the Bluecat Gateway container.
